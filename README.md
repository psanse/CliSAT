# CliSAT
This site contains at present the 501 dataset of structured clique instances tested by the algorithm **CliSAT** for the Maximum Clique Problem (MCP) described in the following paper:

*A SAT-based exact algorithm for hard maximum clique problems* by Pablo San Segundo, Fabio Furini, David Alvarez and Panos Pardalos (2022), (currently under review). 

The instances employed in the tests are provided in the *instances* folder, in their original format.

In the near future, a Linux release of **CLISAT** will be provided.
