# CliSAT
This repository contains at present the 501 dataset of structured clique instances tested by the algorithm **CliSAT** for the **Maximum Clique Problem (MCP)** described in the following article:

*CliSAT: A SAT-based exact algorithm for hard maximum clique problems* by Pablo San Segundo, Fabio Furini, David Alvarez and Panos Pardalos (2022), (currently under review). 

The instances employed in the tests are inside the *instances* folder in their original format.

A Linux release of **CliSAT** is provided in the *bin* folder, together a comparison performance report (which serves as appendix to the article).
