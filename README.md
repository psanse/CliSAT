# CliSAT
This repository contains at present the 501 dataset of structured clique instances tested by the algorithm **CliSAT** for the **Maximum Clique Problem (MCP)** described in the following article:

**CliSAT: A SAT-based exact algorithm for hard maximum clique problems**, Pablo San Segundo, Fabio Furini, David Alvarez and Panos Pardalos, European Journal of Operational Research, 307:3, (2023), pp. 1008-1025 ([available here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221722008165)). 

The instances employed in the tests are inside the *instances* folder in their original format.

A Linux release of **CliSAT** is provided in the *bin* folder, together with  a comparison performance report file *CliSAT.appendix.pdf* (which serves as appendix to the article).
