# CliSAT - an efficient state-of-the-art exact algorithm for the Maximum Clique Problem
This repository contains the testbed of 501 structured clique instances employed to evaluate the performance of **CliSAT**, a very efficient state-of-the-art exact algorithm for the **Maximum Clique Problem (MCP)**. Results are reported in the following article:

**[CliSAT: A SAT-based exact algorithm for hard maximum clique problems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221722008165)**, Pablo San Segundo, Fabio Furini, David Alvarez and Panos Pardalos, European Journal of Operational Research, 307:3, (2023), pp. 1008-1025 ([available here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221722008165)). 

The instances employed in the tests are inside the *instances* folder in their original format.

Windows and Linux releases of **CliSAT** are provided in the *bin* folder, together with  a comparison performance report file *CliSAT.appendix.pdf* (which serves as appendix to the article).
